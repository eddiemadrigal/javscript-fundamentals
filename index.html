            <ul>
                <li>Accessibility means that people are empowered, can be independent, and will not be frustrated by something that is poorly designed or implemented.</li>
                <li>Familiarity is key to properly implementing accessibility.</li>

        <h2>Web Accessibility</h2>
        <p>All people deserve to be treated the same and accessibility allows all users to interact with the site using tools they are used to.  This means that if people use a particular web page, they should view and interact with the site in familiar ways. That is, people should expect their web pages to respond to their devices without much effort.</p>
